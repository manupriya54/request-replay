# C++

A couple tips specifically if you're solving this problem using C++:

## Libraries

We recommend you use [nlohmann's json library][nlohmann/json] and
[cpr][whoshuu/cpr] for implementation. We've added both libraries to
this project, and included a `CMakeLists.txt` that will build them
(using C++17 if supported). If you don't have a preferred CMake workflow,
you can use this:

```bash
# Generate the project scaffolding into cpp/build/
cd cpp
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build the project
cmake --build build
```

You'll need to have [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
installed - we'll link it automatically.

See "Library Installation Instructions" below if don't have `cmake` or `libcurl`.

## json

The json library tries to be pretty magical. Don't be afraid to use
`.get<type>()` instead of relying on it to coerce.

Iterating over json objects is tricky. The best solution we found was
to assign the object to a `std::map<string, json>` and iterate over
that.

## cpr

If you want to set custom headers, know that `cpr::Header` is basically
just a `std::map<string, string>` - you don't have to use their initializer
list syntax. Note that the type has a custom comparison function, so it's
easiest to declare your variable as `cpr::Header`.

We also made a small change from the public docs: `cpr::Payload` has
an overloaded constructor which can take a `std::string`, instead of
only accepting a list of key/value pairs.

## Library Installation Instructions

- If you're using Debian or Ubuntu, you likely want to run `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential`.
- If you're using macOS with HomeBrew installed, you might want to run `brew install cmake curl`.

interview setup](https://github.com/stripe/cpp-interview-prep).
